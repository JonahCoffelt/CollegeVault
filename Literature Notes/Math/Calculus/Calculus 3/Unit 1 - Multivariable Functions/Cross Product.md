If we are to imagine a parallelogram made with two vectors as two sides, then the cross product is the area of this parallelogram:

The only catch is this area is negative because $\vec v$ is on the right of $\vec w$. This is because the order of cross product matters. $$\vec v \times\vec w=-\vec w \times\vec v$$
Here is a quick chart to lay out the positive and negative cross:

| Positive                             | Negative |
| ------------------------------------ | -------- |
| $\vec v$ is on the right of $\vec w$ | $\vec v$ is on the left of $\vec w$         |

One way to remember this is by thinking of the unit vectors:

the first unit vector, $i$ hat, is on the right of the second unit vector, $j$ hat, thus their cross product in order is positive.
