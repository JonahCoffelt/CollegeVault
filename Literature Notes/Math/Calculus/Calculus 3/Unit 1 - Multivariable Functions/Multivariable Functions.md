A multivariable functions takes in multiple numbers, rather than just one. These are able to output a single number like so: $$f(x, y)=x^2+y$$
However, it could also output a vector $$f(x,y)=\begin{bmatrix} 3x\\ 2y \end{bmatrix}$$
Usually, we think of the input as a single point in space (2d or otherwise), which returns a value or vector, rather than two separate variables to combine to create one result.

We may have 3D Graphs:

If we have an $x,y$ input and a single $z$ output. 

We could also visualize this in 2D:

By using different colors for different outputs. 

We may visualize a vector output as so: ![[Pasted image 20230814000421.png]]
