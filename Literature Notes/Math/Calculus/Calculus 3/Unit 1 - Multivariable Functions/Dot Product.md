# Definition
To get the dot product, add the products of like components: $$\begin{bmatrix}a_1\\a_2\end{bmatrix}\cdot\begin{bmatrix}b_1\\b_2\end{bmatrix}=a_1\cdot b_1+a_2\cdot b_2$$
However, we could also define it as such: $$\vec a\cdot\vec b=||\vec a||\mbox{ }||\vec b||\mbox{ }cos(\theta)$$
where $\theta$ is the angle between the vectors. The dot product will be biggest when $\theta=0$, because they are facing the same direction (and $cos(0)=1$). The dot product will be 0 when they are perpendicular ($cos(\frac\pi2)=0$)

# Projection
We can also think about the projection of one vector onto another:

Here, the magnitude of the projection times the magnitude of the blue vector is equal to the dot product. Thus, a large projection means a larger dot product, and a small projection mean a small dot product. 

# Direction
If the vectors are facing the same direction, then the dot product is likely positive. However, if they are facing opposite directions like so:

then the dot product is likely negative.
