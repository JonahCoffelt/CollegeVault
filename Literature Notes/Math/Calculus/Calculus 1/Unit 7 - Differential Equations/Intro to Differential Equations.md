A differential equation relates a function with one or more of its derivatives. Here are some examples: $$y''+2y'=3y$$
$$f''(x)+2f'(x)=3f(x)$$
$$\frac{d^2y}{dx^2}+2\frac{dy}{dx}=3y$$
The solution to a differential equation is a function or set of functions. This differs to an algebraic equation whose solution is a number or a set of numbers.

An example of a solution for the previously shown differential equation is $y=e^{-3x}$. Let's Verify that it is true: $$y'=-3e^{-3x}$$
$$y''=9e^{-3x}$$
Lets put these into the differential equation: $$9e^{-3x}-6e^{-3x}=3e^{-3x}$$
And it works, thus this is a valid solution.
