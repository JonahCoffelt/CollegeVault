#math #derivative 
The first derivative of a function gives us information on the direction of the function.

If $f'(x)$ is positive, then $f(x)$ is increasing. If $f'(x)$ is negative, then $f(x)$ is decreasing. 

# Example
Find the increasing and decreasing intervals of the following function: $$f(x)=x^6-3x^5$$
First, we should take the derivative of the function, and set it equal to 0: $$0=6x^5-15x^4$$
$$0=3x^4(2x-5)$$
$$x=0, x=2.5$$
To find the decreasing interval, use the points we just found to find when $f'(x)<0$
$$0>3x^4(2x-5)$$
$$x<0 \mbox{ or } x<2.5$$
Therefore, $f(x)$ is decreasing when x is less than 2.5, and it is increasing when x is greater than 2.5
