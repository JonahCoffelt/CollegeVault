#math #derivative 
The second derivative tells us about the concavity of a function. 

- If $f''(x)$ is positive, the function it concave up (Smile)
- If $f''(x)$ is negative, the function it concave down (Frown)

# Example:
Here we have the function $x^3+3x^2+x$, and its second derivative
```desmos-graph
left=-4;right=2;
bottom=-3;top=4;
---
x^3+3x^2+x
x=-1|dashed
```
```desmos-graph
left=-4;right=2;
bottom=-3;top=4;
---
6x+6
x=-1|dashed
(-1, 0)|black
```

We can see that when the second derivative is negative, the function is concave down (It looks like a downward curve), and when it is positive it is concave up (an upward curve). There is also a point at $x=-1$ where the function switches from concave down to concave up, this is called a [[Point of Inflection]]
