#math #derivative 
To find an extrema with the second derivative test, first find all of the critical points and points of inflection. Then use a number line to plot out when $f''(x)$ is positive and negative. Finally, follow the two points bellow:
# Max
- $f'(c)=0$ and $f''(c)<0$
# Min
- $f'(c)=0$ and $f''(c)>0$
# Inconclusive:
- $f'(c)=0$ and $f''(c)=0$
