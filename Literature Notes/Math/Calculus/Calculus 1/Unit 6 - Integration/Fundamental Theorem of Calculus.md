#math #theorem 
For some function f(t), we can define an  integral as such: $$F(x)=\int_a^xf(t)dt$$
According to the fundamental theorem of calculus: $$\boxed{\frac{d}{dx}[\int_a^xf(t)dt]=f(x)}$$
In other words, differentiation undoes integration; integration is antidifferentiation. 

# Example:
$$\frac{d}{dt}[\int_\pi^x\frac{cos^2t}{ln(t-\sqrt t)}]=\frac{cos^2x}{ln(x-\sqrt x)}$$
