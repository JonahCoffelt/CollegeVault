Sometimes, we cannot use U-Substitution, so we have to use other methods. Here is one of those methods: $$\int\frac{x-5}{-2x+2}$$
To start this problem, we can do an algebraic long division like so: $$\newcommand\showdiv[1]{\overline{\smash{\big)}#1}} -2x+2\showdiv{x-5}=\frac{-1}2 \mbox{ with remainder of }4$$
And now we can rewrite our Integral: $$\int(\frac{-1}2+\frac2{x-1})dx$$
And this is pretty simply to integrate: $$=\boxed{\frac{-1}2x+2ln|x-1| + C}$$
