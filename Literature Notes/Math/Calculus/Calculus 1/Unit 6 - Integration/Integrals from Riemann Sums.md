Read first the first part of this note:
![[Riemann Sums Base]]

However, if we want to get a more accurate approximation, we could add more rectangles within our interval. If fact, if we add more and more rectangles we will approach the actual area. Thus, we can use a [[Limits]] to give us the real value: $$Area=lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}\sum^n_{i=1}f(x_i)\Delta x_i$$
This is the foundation of integral calculus. What is shown above is an integral, however, we usually notate it as such, where $a$ and $b$ are left and rightmost $x$ value: $$\boxed{Area=\int_a^bf(x)dx}$$You can view the integral sign as a sort of summation sign, but with an infinite number of parts that are being added up.
