# Integral of $\frac1x$ 
If we are to think of the function whose function is $\frac{1}{x}$, we know from [[Derivatives with e]] that it could be $ln(x)$. However, the domain of $\frac1x$ is $x\neq0$, while the domain for $ln(x)$ is $x>0$. Thus in order for this integration to be valid, we must broaden the domain by taking the absolute value of our solution. Thus: $$\boxed{\int\frac1x=ln|x|+C}$$ 
# Integral of $sin(x)$ and $cos(x)$
Refer to table on [[Trigonometric Derivatives]], but go the opposite direction for integration.
$$\boxed{\int sin(x)dx=-cos(x)+C}$$
$$\boxed{\int cos(x)dx=sin(x)+C}$$

# Integral of $e^x$
This one is pretty simple, as $\frac{d}{dx}e^x=e^x$, thus it works the same backwards too:
$$\boxed{\int e^xdx=e^x+C}$$
