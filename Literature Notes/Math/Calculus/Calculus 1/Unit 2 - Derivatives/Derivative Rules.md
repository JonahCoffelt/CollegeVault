# Basic Rules:
## Constant:
The derivative of a constant is 0. This is because a constant has no [[Rate of Change]].
### Example
```desmos-graph
y=1
```
In the above graph, $f(x)=1$, because there is no rate of change (slope), $f'(x)=0$
## Constant Coefficient:
$$\frac{d}{dx}[A\cdot f(x)]=A\cdot\frac{d}{dx}[f(x)]$$
### Example:
$$\frac{d}{dx}[2x^5]=2\frac{d}{dx}[x^5]=2\cdot 5x^4=10x^4$$
## Sum / Difference:
$$\frac{d}{dx}[f(x)\pm g(x)]=\frac{d}{dx}[f(x)]\pm\frac{d}{dx}[g(x)]$$
