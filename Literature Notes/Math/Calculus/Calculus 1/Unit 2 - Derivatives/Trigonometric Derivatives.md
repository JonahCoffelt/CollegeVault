To differentiate sine and cosine, just go down the following list, looping back to the top if at the bottom.

| $sin(x)$  |   $\downarrow$  | 
| --------- | --- |
| $cos(x)$  |  $\downarrow$   |
| $-sin(x)$ |  $\downarrow$   |
| $-cos(x)$ |   back to start |
(ie. derivative of $-sin(x)=-cos(x)$, as shown by the graph

# $sin(x)$
$$\boxed{\frac{d}{dx}[sin(x)]=cos(x)}$$
or $$\frac{d}{dx}[sin(\mu)]=\mu'cos(\mu)$$
# $cos(x)$
$$\boxed{\frac{d}{dx}[cos(x)]=-sin(x)}$$
or $$\frac{d}{dx}[cos(\mu)]=-\mu'sin(\mu)$$

# $tan(x)$
$$\boxed{\frac{d}{dx}tan(x)=sec^2(x)}$$
