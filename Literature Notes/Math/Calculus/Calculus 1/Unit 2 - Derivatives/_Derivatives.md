# Definition of the Derivative
For a linear function or secant line, the rate of change can be defined as $\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}$, which may be rewritten as the following: $$\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}$$This can be rewritten if we define some new variables: $$\mbox{let }x_0=a\mbox{ (starting point)}$$$$\mbox{let }h=b-a \mbox{ (distance between the points)}$$ $$\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}=\frac{f(x_0+h)-f(x_0)}{(x_0+h)-x_0}=\frac{f(x_0+h)-f(x_0)}{h}$$ Thus, to get the instantaneous rate of change at $x_0$, we make the distance between the two points ($h$) smaller and smaller: $$lim_{h\rightarrow 0}\frac{f(x_0+h)-f(x_0)}{h}=\frac{dy}{dx}=f'(x)$$
That's a derivative!
## Alternate Definition Form
$$lim_{a\rightarrow x}\frac{f(x)-f(a)}{x-a}$$
