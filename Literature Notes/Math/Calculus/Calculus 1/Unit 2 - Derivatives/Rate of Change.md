# Average Rate of Change
## Example:
Average velocity can be found using the formula $velocity=\frac{distance}{time}$ . In this example, velocity is the average amount of change in distance in the given timeframe. 

In a linear equation, the slope ($\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}$) is the rate of change:
```desmos-graph
x
```
In the function above, the average rate of change (slope) is 1
# Instantaneous Rate of Change
The primary goal of Differential Calculus is to find the instantaneous rate of change. 
```desmos-graph
x^2-5
```
In the function above, the slope is constantly changing, so we can approximate the rate of change at a point by using a small $\Delta x$. Thus, to find the instantaneous rate of change (slope) at a point we can use the following equation: $$lim_{\Delta x\rightarrow 0}\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}$$This is the derivative. The derivative is usually notated as such: $$\frac{dy}{dx}$$
