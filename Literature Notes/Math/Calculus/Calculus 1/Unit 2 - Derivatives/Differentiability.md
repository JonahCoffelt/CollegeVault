# Conditions for Differentiability
For a function to be differentiable at a point, it meet the following criteria:
1. $\frac{dy}{dx}$ ( also written as $lim_{h\rightarrow 0}\frac{f(x_0+h)-f(x_0)}{h}$ ) must exist and be bounded
	- No vertical tangent 
2. Continuous
	- Not discontinuous
3. $lim_{h\rightarrow 0^-}\frac{f(x_0+h)-f(x_0)}{h}=lim_{h\rightarrow 0^+}\frac{f(x_0+h)-f(x_0)}{h}$
	- No sharp turns (cusp)
