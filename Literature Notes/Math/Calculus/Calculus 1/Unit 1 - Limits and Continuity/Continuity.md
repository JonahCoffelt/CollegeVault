# Continuity at a Point:
$f(x)$ is continuous if $lim_{x\rightarrow c}f(x) = f(c)$ 
- Do you have to pick up your pencil to draw it?
# Continuity Over an Interval:
- For $f(x)$ to be continuous on the interval $(a, b)$, $f(x)$ must be continuous at every point between $a$ and $b$
- For $f(x)$ to be continuous on the interval $[a, b]$, $f(x)$ must be continuous at every point between $a$ and $b$, and both $lim_{x\rightarrow a^+}f(x) = f(a)$ and $lim_{x\rightarrow b^-}f(x) = f(b)$ must be true.
