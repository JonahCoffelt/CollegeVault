## [[Limits]]
- Describes the behavior of a function as it approaches a point
## [[Properties of Limits]]
- Mostly intuitive properties, as operations inside the limit can be done outside as well
## [[Limit of Composite Functions]]
- $lim_{x\rightarrow a}f(g(x)) = f(lim_{x\rightarrow a}g(x))$
- Has prerequisites 
## [[Limits by Direct Substitution]]
- $lim_{x\rightarrow a}f(x)=f(a)$ 
- If continuous at a
## [[Squeeze Theorem]]
- Used to find the limit of tricky functions.
## [[Discontinuities]]
- A break in a function
## [[Continuity]]
- Do you have to pick up your pencil?
## [[Removing Discontinuities]]
- Fill in the holes in the function
