# Problem 1
Eddie drove from NYC to Philly. The function D gives the total distance Eddie as driven (in km) $t$ hours after he left.

**What is the best interpretation of the following statement?** $$D'(2)=100$$
## Solution
At time $t=2\mbox{ hours}$, Eddie was driving at a rate of $100 \frac{km}{h}$ 
# Problem 2
A tank is being drained of water. The function $V$ fives the volume of the liquid in the tank, in liters, aster $t$ minutes.

**What is the best interpretation of the following statement?** 

The slope of the line tangent to the graph of $V$ at $t=7$ is equal to $-3$

## Solution
At time $t=7$ minutes, the water was being drained at a rate of 3 liters per minute.
