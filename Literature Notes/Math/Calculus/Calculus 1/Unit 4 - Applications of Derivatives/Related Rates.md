# Circle & Radius Example
Given a circle with a radius of $3 cm$ that is growing at a rate of $1\frac{cm}{sec}$, **at what rate is the area increasing?**

To start this problem, we should lay out what we know and what we are looking for. We know both the radius and the rate that the radius is growing: $$r=3cm$$$$\frac{dr}{dt}=1\frac{cm}{sec}$$
And we need to find the rate that the area is growing: $$\frac{dA}{dt}=?$$
Now that we have this, we should define a relationship between the radius and the area. Doing this is pretty simple, as it is just the formula for are of a circle: $$A=\pi r^2$$
Since we are looking for the derivative of $A$, we should now take the derivative of both sides with respect to time: $$\frac{dA}{dt}=2\pi r\cdot\frac{dr}{dt}$$
Finally, we can use the information that we laid out above to fill in the variables: $$\frac{dA}{dt}=2\pi(3cm)(1\frac{cm}{sec})$$
Giving us our final answer of: $$\boxed{\frac{dA}{dt}=6\pi\frac{cm^2}{sec}}$$
As a side note, we know that the unit of area, in this scenario, is $cm^2$, but if we weren't sure of this, we can simply bring all of the units through the whole process, treating them as you would a variable. You can see that in this example, it gave us the correct unit.
