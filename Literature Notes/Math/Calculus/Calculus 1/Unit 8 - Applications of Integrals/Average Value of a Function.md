$$f(x)_{avg}=\frac1{b-a}\int_a^bf(x)dx$$
$$x\in[a, b]$$

Assume we are given a function $f(x)$, and we want to find the average height between two bounds.

What we can do is first take the area underneath the curve (Integral). Now, we can imagine some rectangle with the same base between $a$ and $b$, and with a height $h$, such that is area is equal to the area under the curve. This value $h$ will be the average value of the function from $a$ to $b$. I like to think of it like the area under the curve is water, and if we let it flow, it will level out into the shape of this rectangle. ![[Pasted image 20230810122105.png]]
