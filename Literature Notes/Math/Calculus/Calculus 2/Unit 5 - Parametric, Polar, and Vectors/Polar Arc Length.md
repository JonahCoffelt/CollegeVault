#math #polar
Very similar to the [[Arc Length of Parametric Curves]], but in terms of $\theta$. The start of this proof is the same as the start of the parametric proof, so I will just start in the middle and pick where is is different between the two: $$\sqrt{dx^2+dy^2}$$
Now, we can define $dx$ and $dy$ in the context of polar as: $$dx=$$
