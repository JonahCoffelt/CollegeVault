#math #trig #polar
Where a rectangular coordinate uses $(x, y)$, a polar coordinate uses $(R, \theta)$, where is is the radius, and $\theta$ is the angle measured from the positive x axis.

We can see that the point $(3, 45\degree)$

is on the third circle from the origin, at an angle of $45\degree$.

If $R$ is negative, then instead of going forward, go the opposite direction (same as adding $180\degree$). Here we can se how this works with the point $(-2, 60\degree)$

where red is the marked angle and blue is where you actually should go. 

We can convert polar coordinates to rectangular coordinates with the following equations: $$x=Rcos\theta$$
$$y=Rsin\theta$$
We can, inversely, convert a rectangular coordinate to polar with the following equations: $$R=\sqrt{x^2+y^2}$$
$$\theta=tan^{-1}(\frac{y}{x})$$
We can also make polar equations, here are some examples: $$R=sin(\theta)$$
$$R=3cos(2\theta)$$
