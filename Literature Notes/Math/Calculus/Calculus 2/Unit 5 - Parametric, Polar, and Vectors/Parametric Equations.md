#math #trig #parametric
A parametric equation puts $x$ and $y$ in terms of a third variable, $t$, separate from each other. 

An example of this would be $x=t+2$, $y=t^2$, $-2\leq x\leq 2$. For use to work with this function, we can create a table of points at different values of $t$:

| t   | x   | y   |
| --- | --- | --- |
| -2  | 0   | 4   |
| -1  | 1   | 1   |
| 0   | 2   | 0   |
| 1   | 3   | 1   |
| 2   | 4   | 4   |
