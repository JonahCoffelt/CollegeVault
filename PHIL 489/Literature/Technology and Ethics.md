# How technology mediates ethics and politics
Technology allows us to control our world and our fate. There are two main ways that technology mediates us and our world. Firstly, **Technologies mediate the powers wee have to act in the world.*** For example, we can use a hammer and nails to fuse wood. Secondly, **Technology mediates how we experience people and the environment** For example, phones and internet allow us to communicate better with people, and microscopes enhance our sight. However, technology also has the ability to mold us and out behavior. 

When considering how technology effects ethical decision making, we must consider the technological tools and abilities at the disposal of the subject making an ethical choice. We must also be aware of the entire techno social collective that contributes to said technology. 

When we think about the dimension that society adds to ethics, it is important to realize the flux nature of society as it progresses, grows, and weakens,. 

In a similar way to a societal shifts, the technological landscape can have massive impacts on the the ethics of a society. Often times, the ethics of a given society have to catch up to the ever changing technology. For example, the invention of the car brought new traffic laws and regulations, thus altering the ethical landscape. However, these catch up's can often be too slow. For example, the industrial revolution brought about a wave of worker exploitation, and the internet boom created the opportunity for the information market to be born, wearing away at our personal privacy. 

There are two primary stances on the ethics of the progression of technology, as well as a third middle ground position: 
## Technological Optimists
Believe that human like is, on average, better with more technology. Notably, technology has improved life expectancy and quality. Additionally, many more can live wealthy comfortable lives. 
## Technological Pessimists 
Believe that technology has been marginally beneficial, but it ultimately decreases quality of life. One massive example of this is climate change, which, due to technology, has the capacity to make Earth unlivable and unsustainable. Another point is that technology degrades human relationships and experiences. 

## Technological Realists/ Technological Determinists
Believe that technology has tremendous benefits, thought there are substantial problems that must be addressed as well. They see the advancement of technology as something that cannot be stooped or abandoned due to its benefits. 


# Theories of technological mediation
José Ortega y Gasset argued that technology changes what can be done, but not what should be done. Heidegger views the world of a resource of truth to be used, which he claims can be linked back to Aristotle's intellectual virtue of techne, thus a characteristic of eudemonia. Jacques Ellul Argued that technological advancement devalues uniqueness, beauty and skill. 

## Technological Counter Productivity
Theory that argues that  technology's result is often contrary to its initial aim. For example, cars intended to provide a quick means of transport, but their side effects are pollution, mutinous, high cost of production of cars and roads, and injuries. When these costs are added in the form of time, it is only slightly faster than walking, but slower than biking. 

## Technological Moral Imperitive
Hans Jonas believed that technology created a new moral imperative to use technology, which is able to altar and destroy the environment, responsibly. The imperative is to 'act so that the effects of your action  are compatible with the permanence of genuine human life'

# Contemporary research
Current reassert is focused on a particular field or application of technology. For example, Tom Beauchamp and James Childress’s popularized the idea of mid-level principals in bioethics, which are compatible with virtue ethics, deontological ethics, and utilitarianism. These principals focus on beneficence, not doing harm, autonomy for the patient, and justice. 

The 'empirical turn' focuses on the shift away from critiques of classical philosophy of technology toward analysis that (1) focuses on design and development, not just use (2) is local, rather than global; and (3) prioritizes empirical case studies. Peter-Paul Verbeek argues that human and artifact are a single hybrid. For example, it is impossible to escape the impact the microwave has had on food and grocery stores.

Shannon Vallor recontextualized virtue ethics when applied to case studies of media, surveillance technologies, war robots, and human enhancement. These yield "technomoral" virtues which guide how to live well with emerging technologies.
