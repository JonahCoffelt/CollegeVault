# Coordinates
The coordinate system in 3D is defined by $(x, y, z)$

# Basic Equations
Any equation that we used in 2D will be projected in 3D space. For example, a line becomes a plane, and a circle becomes a cylinder.
## Plane
A plane is any equation which stratifies the following, where $x$, $y$, and $z$ are all first degree:
$$ax + by + cz = d$$
## Cylinder
The equation for a cylinder is just the equation of a circle, given that we are in 3D space. Here is a quick example: 
$$(y+2)^2+(z-2)^2=2^2$$
This would make a circle of radius 4 on the point $(0, -2, 2)$,, which would be extended out without bounds on the $x-axis$.

# Sphere
A sphere with center $(h,k,l)$ and radius $r$ can be represented as such:
$$(x-h)^2+(y-k)^2+(z-l)^2$$
Which is just the 3D extension of the circle equation.
