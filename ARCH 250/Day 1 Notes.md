# Gothic Architecture
## Notre Dame
Formed in a cross shape in order to portray a central element of the faith. The orientation is East to West, starting from the bottom of the cross, in order to portray a pilgrimage. As you walk up the cathedral, the glass tells stories of the Bible. This use of lighting was made possible through the use of the pointed arches which can carry a heavy load.
