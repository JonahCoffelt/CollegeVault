# New Technologies
New materials such as iron, new methods such as practical evaluation of structures using math and physics, and new techniques with the advent of the Industrial Revolution. 
# Great Exhibition
This event was meant to showcase developments of arts, sciences, and architecture. Paxton won the competition for the design competition for the Great Exhibition of London in 1851. This structure needed to be quickly constructed. Demonstrated prefabrication of construction elements and modular design. Many elements, such as the arches, were first built on the ground, then lifted into place. They would use both human and horse power to raise elements. The panes of glass, which were the largest size ever, were inserted into the system of furrow and ridge. The building was nicknamed the glass palace. The entire building was complete in 8 months by contractors Sir Charles Fox and George Henderson.

After the event, the entire building was deconstructed and reconstructed at Sydenham. The building was destroyed in a fire in 1936.
# Divergent Approaches
The Ecole des Beaux-Arts was more so focused on the fine art design of architecture, while the Ecole Centrale des Arts et Manufactures was focused on the practical methods and techniques of architecture. 
## Ecole des Beaux-Arts
### Bibliotheque Sainte-Genevieve, Paris, 1842-1850, Henri Laborouste
This was built on the site of a medieval basilica, and a library dedicated to Sainte-Genevieve. This was the first public library of France as a part of a larger urban renewal project in Paris. This building takes inspiration from the Medici Palazzo. The interior reading room was inspired by roman barrel vaults, which here are built by plaster and wire supported by cast-iron arches and columns. The clearstory windows invite natural lighting. 
### L'Opera, Paris, 1861-1875, Jean-Louis-Charles Garnier
Garnier was a student at Beaux-Arts. He received a scholarship to visit Italy and Greece and see the architecture. The exterior draws heavy influence from Baroque architecture. The rooms were arranged hierarchically such that they can achieve their function. The first room is the entrance foyer, which is followed by the staircases which are covering in surface ornamentation that lead up to the seating. The auditorium has a dome. The seating was often divided among social class, with the more important individuals being closer to the stage
## Ecole Centrale des Arts et Manufactures
Created in 1829 in order to develop practical applications of great scientific discoveries. For example, the tire was developed using rubber by Michelin, Bleriot created planes, and Peugeot created cars.
### Gustave Eiffel
His early commissions included bridges for trains, which he made of wrought iron with a parabolic arch design. 
# 19th Century England
## House of Parliament, London, 1836-1868
Rebuilt after a fire in 1834. The plan of the building was designed by Sir Charles Bary and the Decoration was built by Pugin. 

# 19th Century America
## Trinity Church, NYC, Richard Upjohn, 1839-1846
Upjohn was an Episcopalian, and was strongly influenced by Pugin. The church takes a decorated gothic style from England. The church has a graveyard with many prominent figures. The ceiling vaults were built of wood and plaster rather than stone due to the lack of skilled stone masons in the US. This of the first examples of stained glass windows in a US building. 
## Washington National Cathedral
Built with a Gothic Cathedral style. The stone work was made and maintained by Immigrants from Italy. The glass is vibrantly colored and depict aspects of US history. The gargoyles features figures from pop culture and history. 
## Arts and Crafts Movements
John Ruskin wrote the *Seven Lamps of Architecture* which advocated against the degradation of both the individual and the craft which resulted from industrialization. William Morris, who followed Ruskin, founded a company to employ craftsmen to make handmade products. His house was built to express these values, as well as the "cult of domesticity". The glass of the windows featured hand-painted panels. The art was painted directly on the walls
## Trinity Church, Boston, Massachusetts, H.H. Richardson, 1872-1877
The facade is inspired by the Romanesqu church of St. Gilles-du-Gard. This style, which utilizes polychrome stonework, triple portal withround arches supported by columns and sculpture, is known as Richardsonian Romanesque.

The interior, as a characteristic of Romanesque architecture, is dimmer. The influence of the arts and craft movement can be seen in the woodwork which decorates the inside, as well as in the stained glass windows and murals. 
## Glessner House, Chicago, 1885, H.H. Richardson
Originates from the Gilded Age by a wealth industrial family, The house cost $60,000 ($1.87 million today). The exterior is rock-faced granite masonry with rounded arches. The decoration in the house reflects the Arts and Crafts movement

## Biltmore House
Richard Morris Hunt was the first American to travel to Paris and attend the Ecole des Beaux-Arts. He built houses for the wealthiest members of society during the Gilded Age. Hunt designed a family estate for the Vanderbilt family on a 125,000 arch plot of land. Frederick Law Olmstead designed the gardens and farms on the estate which were meant to be worked to provide income and revenue. The home designed by hunt was designed to like like a French Renaissance Chateau. The construction of the house took 6 years, required thousands of workers, and cost around $180 million in todays money. The house had 250 rooms, including a banqueting hall, library, music room, swimming pool, and a bowling alley. 

## Boston Public Library, 1887-1895, McKim, Mead, White
This was the first free large library in America. McKim referred to this as a "palace for the people". The building was designed after the Bibliotheque Sainte-Genevieve, whose designer, along with McKim, studied at Ecole des Beaux-Arts. The ground floor leads to a main staircase which is built of yellow marble from Siena. Lion statues in the staircase serve as a memorial to Massachusetts volunteer infantries in the Civil War. Eight murals around the staircase represent intellectual categories, such philosophy, poetry, and physics.

The reading room is designed like a Roman basilica with a barrel vault. 

# Chicago School
A group of architects that redesigned Chicago after the fire. They used new materials, such as steel, and new techniques such as steel skeletons which would be efficiently and quickly constructed. The building techniques and materials were able to maximize occupancy while being fireproof and stable for the swampy ground of Chicago. 
## Monadnock Building, Chicago, Daniel Burnham and John Root, 1890-1891.
Danial Burnham and John Root built the first skyscraper 1890-1891, which was seen as a precursor to modern architecture. This was the largest office building of its time. Thick masonry walls made it stable but expensive to build. The internal Iron frame provided lateral bracing against the winds. 
## Reliance Building, Daniel, Root, and Atwood, 1894-1895
Burnham and also designed the Reliance Building, which was also a precursor to modern architecture. The factory assembled two story tall steel beams allowed the steel frame to be built in 15 days. Atwood took over the ornamentation of the building after Root passed, and he created much window space. The exterior features colonettes and square terracotta classing which resembles Gothic tracery. The building now serves as a hotel. 
## Carson Pirie Scott Department Store, Chicago, IL, 1899-1904. Louis Sullivan.
This building was built in the Art Nouveau style, with columns that resemble flowers, revealing the influence of nature on Art Nouveau. Art Nouveau viewed the city as a hostile environment to live in, so Art Nouveau tried to counter this by introducing beauty and nature into the buildings. There is some cornice, but mostly, Louis uses a visual barrier to mark the top of the building.
## Auditorium Building Chicago, 1886-1890, Dankmar Adler and Louis Sullivan
The goal of the building was to be multipurpose to serve a large part of society and maintain economic viability. The building had a central auditorium, office rooms, hotel rooms, and business locations on the ground floor. Historic forms of arcades and columns provide height to the exterior. The auditorium had few boxes, as it was meant to be an auditorium for the people. 
## Chicago World Fair (Columbian Exposition), 1893
Intended to showcase the latest agriculture, machinery and manufacturing. The plan is like a small city. The Beaux-Arts tradition is seen in the court of honor, and Classical and Renaissance styles are seen in the buildings. The cornice height was the same for every building, but there was much room for creativity in other aspects. Many of the walls, excluding the museum, were made of stall, a mixture of plaster, cement, and jute fibers. Everything was painted white due to time constraints, thus the nickname the "white city". There was extensive exterior electric lighting for the night time.
