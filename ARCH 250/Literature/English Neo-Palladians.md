## Chiswick House, London, Lord Burlington and William Kent
This building was an adaptation of the Villa Rotonda. However, instead of a circular dome, the Chiswick House had an octagonal dome with a drum. The stairs on the Chiswick House are much more winding, rather than connected to the landscape. The statues on the Chiswick House feature Palladio and Indigo Jones.

The building has a quare plan with a central octagonal dome. The half windows on the dome, from Palladio's adaptation of Roman bath houses, are called thermal
windows because of their original purpose of bringing in heat. The interior features decoration with classical sculptures, broken pediments, Gilded ornaments, and Brackets and cornice at the top of walls.

The Library features framed bookshelves based on the old Church of St. Paul. The Holbein Room features sketches by Holbein. Walpole was a collector of art. The decoration around the fireplace was a copy of the tomb of Archbishop Wareham in Westminster Abbey. The round room features a room pattern which was based on the tracery in the rose window from Old St. Paul's. The gallery, which was used for entertaining, imitates the Perpendicular style pendant vaults, but uses paper Mache.
