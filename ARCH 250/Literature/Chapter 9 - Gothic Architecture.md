# Introduction
Gothic architecture is the final phase of medieval architecture from the 12th to 14th century. However, it is often to define what exactly Gothic architecture is. One key element is the pointed arch and rib vault.

Other indications of Gothic Architecture include flying buttresses, windows with tracery, piers composed of colonnettes or shafts bundled around a core.

Apart from these key features, the structure of Gothic Architecture is often like a skeletal system that transfers the load over various points rather than a continuous mass of wall. This allows for larger spaces and windows in place of walls.  Because of this, Gothic Architecture often tends to emphasize vertical form and cells of space which have a sense of openness. 

But how are the key elements able to contribute to this style and feel? Whereas a semicircular arch has a height that is equal to half of its span, a pointed arch may have a higher tip, allowing for a more cast feeling space. In addition to this, the rib arches, while also being more advantageous to construction, allows for a cleaner feel on the ribs than the traditional groin vault. Finally, the flying buttresses allow for the weight, which is often concentrated in key points due to the nature of Gothic architecture, to be reenforced. This allows for the skeletal design to remain stable yet spacious. 
# Early Gothic
## The Abbey Church of St. Denis

## Cathedrals
The rise of cathedrals coincided with the increase in popularity of the Virgin Mary, thus many cathedrals took the name "Notre Dame", meaning "Our Lady"
### Notre-Dame at Laon
This cathedral began construction in about 1155 and was finished by about 1205. The semicircle apse was replaced to provide more room for the canons. Flying buttresses were added in the 13th century to provide more stability to lateral wind forces, though this was not in the initial design. This building differs from Romanesque architecture in its boldness; the front 3portals are protected  by hoods, which adds a sense of depth to the façade. This depth is expended by the traced arched windows.

The interior features sexpartite rib vaults which is carried over from the Roman precedent. However, the pointed arches create a sense of verticality that was never seen before. This verticality is further emphasized by the shaft piers.

This is one of the purest examples of early Gothic Architecture.
### Notre-Dame of Paris
This cathedral began construction in 1150 and was completed about 1250. It was built to replace a basilica (a church building that has been accorded special privileges by the pope). This cathedral is 110 feet tall. The original light proved to be insufficient, so the clerestories (upper windows) were enlarged. In order to provide more stabilization, flying buttresses were built, and the original buttresses were rebuilt. Later, chapels were installed between the buttresses.

The west front is much more solid that the front of the Laon cathedral. It also features a triple portal, though here, there is a gallery of kings (to represent the 28 kings of the Old Testament). The virgin and child with two angels is featured on a halo shaped glass backdrop. While the façade initially appears symmetrical, there are subtle differences in each side. None of the portals are the same, and the two towers are different in width.

# High Gothic
High, or mature, Gothic abandons much of the Romanesque remnants that remained in the Early Gothic buildings, refining the periods artistic and structural features.
## Chartres and Bourges
### Cathedral of Notre-Dame at Chartres
This cathedral was connect to the Virgin Mary via a cloth relic of the tunic of the Virgin Mary. Relics are important because they are tangible objects that connect to the abstract idea of faith. This is the first building that had flying buttresses planned from the start, eliminating the need for galleries (the space above the side aisles). The façade featured 3 portals like the earlier Gothic buildings. 6 more portals were later added, 3 on each transept arm (the cross). Many sculptures are featured in the jambs, telling the theology of salvation.
![[Pasted image 20230824113007.png]]
The interior was simplified into 3 divisions: the nave arcade, the triforium passage, and the clerestory windows. The windows were increased greatly in size, with improved tracery, creating vibrant luminous light on the interior. The vaults shifted from sexpartite (An Romanesque precedent) to quadripartite. Much of the vaulting, piers, and buttresses are designed to appear as if they are freely floating, creating a sense of lightness. 
### Cathedral of St. Etienne at Bourges
This cathedral presents a sharp contrast to Chartres. Bourges used a double aisle design which wrapped around the nave and choir. Although this provided greater structural support and cost efficiency, it limited the size of the clerestory windows. This structural design allowed for 5 major volumes. This building utilized flying buttresses which followed the slope of the roof.

## The Sainte-Chapelle
This was built in France by Louis IX as a repository for relics, such as the Crown of Thorns and a piece of the True Cross, which cost twice the cost of construction. This building had two levels; the ground floor was used for household servants, and the upper level, decorated with stained glass with bar tracery was for the royal family. The upper level featured jewel-like colors and massive glass windows.

# English Gothic 1175-1540
The Gothic style originated in France, but it was adapted and evolved by the English in this era. This era is often broken into 3 sub-eras, which often overlap (features of these sub periods are often found within individual buildings, due to construction time):
## Early English 1175-1265
Mainly in France. Included basic gothic features, such as quadpartite vaults and lancet shaped windows. 
## Decorated Period 1250-1370
Increased the complexity of gothic features. Tierceron and lierne vaults had extra ribs, and windows were fashioned into trefoil and quatrefoil cusps (clover-like shapes), and intersecting and flowing lines. 
## Perpendicular Period 1330-1540
Mostly an English period. Once again, the gothic features were made even more elaborate. Vaults were often in conical fan shapes, and windows had distinguished panel tracery. 
## Canterbury Cathedral 
Built in England upon the Norman Church, retaining only the crypt and aisle walls. The church featured a pilgrimage which linked the site of Archbishop St. Thomas a Becket's martyrdom with his shrine in the Trinity Chapel. The apsidal chapels were set at an angle to the main axis rather than radiating from it. The Corona chapel was at the end of the church. There are two transepts, one on the east and one on the west of the choir. The crossing tower, named Bell Harry, was built 235 feet high in the perpendicular period.

## Salisbury Cathedral 1220-1258
This is a rare example of a cathedral which was built entirely in the Early English Period. This cathedral emphasizes horizontal rather than vertical structure, with horizontal lines running along the interior and exterior. The quadpartite vaults are not supported by piers running down, but wall corbels. The flying buttresses also do not contribute to a sense of verticality. 
## Lincoln Cathedral 1192-1280
The Lincoln cathedral features various interior vaults, most notably, the choir's "crazy" vaults which are asymmetric. The retrochoir (called the Angel Choir in this cathedral) is filled with marble trim, angel sculptures, and a large window with tracery of the Decorated Period.
## Ely Cathedral 1081-1336
The western façade and nave originate from the Norman Romanesque era. The crossing tower and Lady Chapel were built in the English Gothic era. In The Lady Chapel, the ornamental statues of the lower walls reflect the decorated style. These were, however, destroyed. The fan vaults create a strong vertical emphasis from the perpendicular style. The crossing tower, which collapsed in the 14th century due to the wetlands soil, is built to be light, made of wood in a hammerbeam truss formation, and exert more lateral force on piers. The outside of the tower is covered in stone to retain the desired look.

# Universities
## Kings College, Cambridge England, 1446-1515
This college included a chapel of the perpendicular period for students. The interior features fan vaults divided into bay by the transverse arches. 
# Houses
Housing in Medieval Europe was often determined by the materials of the land and the climate. 
## Longhouse
For lower status citizens. These structures would combine houses and barns into one. These included open rooms for residents and a long barn for livestock. This was all included under one roof. The heat from the bodies would warm the building. 
![[Pasted image 20230905133020.png]]
## Manor House
For landowners of higher social status. The main hall was used for eating and entertainment. The solar rooms were more private rooms for the family to work. The buttery was for perishable goods. These buildings were often a display of the family and their status
![[Pasted image 20230905133345.png]]
## Townhouses
Combined a living location with a ground floor business/shop. These were necessarily located in city so that there were sufficient customers. Land was often expensive, so these featured more stories, often each one bigger than the last. Due to the density of townhouses and the flammable materials, they would very easily burn in large numbers.

# Hospitals
These buildings were designed to care for the lower class and the sick. These were often much more expansive than our modern hospitals. Rather than focus on medicine, which was lacking at the time, they focused on providing care to those who need it. They would give food to the poor, they would care for elderly, pray for the salvation of terminally ill peoples, and they would pray for the sick. These buildings were often based on the faith. 
These were often built from donations. Patrons were often women. 
## Hotel-Dieu (Hospital) Notre Dame de Fontenilles
The patron of this building was Margaret of Burgundy. She provided money as well as the resources on her land. When she died, she was buried in the chapel of the building. The building uses stone masonry with stone buttresses. Used a timber roof. The purpose was to care for the poor, sick, and pregnant. The interior uses a barrel vault with wooden framework. 
![[Pasted image 20230905134701.png]]
## Hotel-Dieu of Beaune France
Founded by Nicolas Rolin, Chancellor to the Duke of Burgundy, and his wife. Rolin believed that by founding this building, he would ensure his salvation. A river flows through the complex, which is used for water. The funds supported a group of nuns who would support for the patients. This also used a barrel vault with wooden framework, which a chapel at the end of the building.

# Castles
![[Pasted image 20230907124842.png]]
The goal of a castle was often to defend a particular institution. It is very difficult to attack castles because of the fortified architecture. However, enemies would often try to take down castles by depleting their resources, such as water, food, and ammunition, and by potentially infecting the castle population with disease. 
## Louvre, Paris, France
Built by the kings of France, starting with Phillippe Auguste.
## Caernarfon Castle, Wales
This castle was build by King Edward I of England in order to establish power in Wales. This castle is strategically located on a river coast on high ground. This castle was overseen by trusted officials of the king.
