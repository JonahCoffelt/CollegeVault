Architecture is certainly shelter, but there is much more to it. There are 3 main goals of architecture stability, commodity, and delight. **Stability** describes the structural integrity, **commodity**, the functionality, and **delight** the beauty of a building. The most elusive of these is beauty, being so subjecting and flux. Beauty can be achieved through the natural demands of the building, the inevitable result of the buildings materials, or by ornamentation. 

In order to make buildings, there must be a **motive**, **means**, and **system** to create it. The motive is often a functional need or for culture. Additionally, buildings, weather company buildings, homes, or religious buildings, we express some form of personality or image that they wish to portray. The means to create a building are often money and resources. The architectural landscape will often be determined by the resources in that area. Innovations in materials, such as steel or concrete, or the improved transportation of materials can shift the architectural landscape. 

## Architectural System
There are 5 categories of architectural systems
### Post and Lintel / Trabeated
Post and Lintel systems are formed by vertical and horizontal members, like posts and beams. These are the most common. The distance between posts it determined by the load capacity of the posts and the beams themselves. ![[Pasted image 20230823164618.png]]
### Corbeling
Lays stones (or wood) on top of other stones, which each stone extending slightly further out then the previous. By doing this, civilizations were able to overcome stones weakness in tension.

### Arches and Vaults
Masonry arches are created by tightly compressing wedge-shaped stones together on a semi-circular brace until they are self supporting. This requires strong lateral bracing, as there is also lateral thrust created by this form. A vault is a linear extension of an arch.

### Trussing
This method uses short wooden or metals elements in a triangular pattern in order to span a large distance. This was originally done by the Romans, though it was reinvented in the 19th century. The equilateral triangle design was patented the Warren Truss, named after the designer. A truss repeated in 3 dimensions is a space frame.

### Tensile
These rely heavily on tensile forces, such ass rope, cable, or fabric.. These offset some of load to many intertwined fibers or cables. Examples of this are fabric tents and suspension bridges. ![[Pasted image 20230823170325.png]]

## Drawings and Images
### Plans
A plan shows a building from above with a horizontal plane slice through it. Thin lines represent what is bellow the cut, thick lines represent what is above the cutting plane, and dotted lines represent ceiling elements. 
### Elevation
An elevation shows the front vertical face of the building.
### Section
A section shows a vortical slice of the balding, showing the interior.

### Perspective
Shows the building as if it were being viewed in a photograph. This uses foreshortening to appear realistic, but distorts some of the dimensions to achieve this.

### Axonometric
Similar to a perspective drawing, as it shows the outside, but it does not distort dimensions. To do this, however, the angles must be distorted.

### Analytic
Shows the perspective view of the structure (such as frame and chimney) of the building. This can be especially useful for architects.
