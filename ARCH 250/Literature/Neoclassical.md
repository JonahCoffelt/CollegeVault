# French Neoclassical
Based on classical architecture. Uses geometric forms, such as circles, squares, and pyramids. Many of the designs were too advanced to be built at the time.
## Cenotaph for Newton, Boullee
in 1780 Boullee wrote a book describing architecture as an expressive picture and visual poetry. This project was designed to honor the discovery of Newton. It was a hollow sphere perforated at the top to create a model of the universe when viewed from the inside.

## Saline Royale, Chaux France, Claude-Nicholas Ledoux, 1775-1779
This was planned industrial community, for the production of salt, with a directors house in the center, buildings for salt production, and workers houses. The areas beyond the houses had gardens and recreational buildings which were a vision of Utopia. The semicircular plan reflects a theater.

The design of the buildings were inspired by classical design, but many features were 'speaking architecture' as they spoke to the purpose of the buildings. For example the entrance of the Gatehouse is meant to look like a salt mine. The directors house had a window on the front, representing oversight. The columns are broken into squares to imitate Italian mannerism. 
# German Neoclassical
## Karl Friedrich Schinkel (1781-1841)
He worked as a stage designer and a painter. He was employer in the Prussian public works office. He believed the Greek architecture was ideal to represent civic designs.
### Altesmuseum, Berlin, Karl Friedrich Schinkel, 1823-1828 
This was the first public art museum in Europe. This building has a long facade with Ionic columns. The walls imitate the walls from the Roman houses in Pompeii. The interior, though not visible from the outside, is a Rotunda that references the design of the pantheon. The building is multiple stories, with the galleries providing a perimeter to each story. 
# North American Neoclassical
## Thomas Jefferson
Thomas Jefferson had a vast education in Renaissance Science and Philosophy. 
### Virginia State Capitol 
He served as an ambassador to France, where he studied the works of Ledoux and Boulle, as well as the Maison Carree, Nimes, which was a part of Roman France. Jefferson liked the connection of US values to the idea of a republic which was defined by Rome.

While in France, Jefferson worked with Charles-Louis Clerisseau to develop a design. A plaster model of the design was made by Jean-Pierre.

Although the colonnade was maintained with 6 columns, the capitols were changed from Corinthian to Ionic due to the challenges of Corinthian masonry. Both of the building had a front facing focus.

In 1904, two wings were added to the side of the building for chambers for the Senate and the House of Representatives. The Romans had a Senate building, but Jefferson did not see it, and it was simply a big box. 
In 2004, construction of a museum underneath the the grounds of the building was completed.
### University of Virginia
Jeffersons view for this campus was based on the Chateau de Marly, France, which was built during the Renaissance. 
![[Pasted image 20231109133149.png]]
The central feature of the campus was to be the lawn, which rose toward the north end where the rotunda of the library is. In the Chateau de Marly, the building at the focal point was for the king. In the university, this building was known as a "temple of knowledge". The use of the library as a focal point was suggested by William Thornton. 
![[Pasted image 20231109133726.png]]
The design of the library was based on the Pantheon. One of the biggest similarities is the use of the dome. Additionally, both have Corinthian columns. However, the building in Virginia is raised, but not the Pantheon. The porch in Virginia only has 6 columns, instead of 8. Jefferson added a clock window to the pediment. In interior was divided into multiple spaces and stories in order to accommodate the library and learning space for students. 
![[Pasted image 20231109135737.png]]
The pavilions around the lawn each had two roles: classrooms and housing for the faculty. The fa√ßades were meant to serve as architectural models for the students. In between the pavilions were multiple one room dorms. Jefferson intended for the lawn to serve as a community of learning that included the faculty and the students. 

## US Capitol, William Thorton, 1793
The central dome, which was based on the Pantheon, symbolized the unity between the wings of the House and the Senate. 
# Federal Architecture
The capitol building was a result of a competition. 
## Henry Latrobe
English architect of the Freemasons. He emigrated to the US, where he was apportioned Surveyor of Public Buildings in Washington by Thomas Jefferson. Latrobe took much inspiration from the classical orders. 
## US Capitol
In the old Senate Chamber, Latrobe used a semidome, taking after the pantheon, as well as ionic columns. Each state contributes two statues to the chamber. Congress decided to included a statue of a seated Rosa Parks. 
From 1850 to 1864, Thomas U. Walter deigned the new dome and house/senate wings. This happened during Lincolns presidency, a cost which he justified by saying that the Union would live on. Emancipation Hall recognizes the contribution of enslaved workers who helped to build the US Capitol.
