1. Baroque Facade
	- Corner pavilions, Rusticated masonry on ground floor, Colossal Columns, Central pediment with sculpture. 
# Il Gesu, Italy, 1568-1576, Giacomo Vignola and Giacomo della Porta
The patron was from the Farnese family. This is a baroque building due to its scale. Features large Corinthian columns, triangular pediments. The central coat of arms with IHS, the monogram of Christ. The statues on either side depict triumph of the faith, with St. Ignatius standing on a woman as a personification of Heresy. The plan was designed with emphasis on individual and emotional participation, with chapels replacing aisles, and shortened transepts.

## Triumph of the Name of Jesus
The nave has a simple barrel vault, but it has a ceiling fresco that depicts heaven. The figures in light are heading to heaven, while those in dark are to be damned. Much of it is flat, but it creates the illusion of three dimensions.

## Tomb and altar of St. Ignatius
In the north transept. This features his efforts to push back against the protestant reformation, as well as attracts pilgrims. The marble and stone is all naturally colored in the tomb, which signifies the churches wealth to paint with architecture in this way.

# Old St. Peter's Basilica, Rome, Italy, 318-322
This church was built above the tomb of St. Peter, where he was buried as a martyr, during the rule of Constantine in Rome. This would have been one of the largest building at the time of its building due to its number of pilgrims.
![[Pasted image 20231031131818.png]]
In the 15th century, Pope Nicholas V asked Alberti to report on the condition of the building. At this time, many other buildings, statues, tombs, and monuments had been added onto the church. Alberti concluded that the building was not structurally sound due to the walls leaning outward. Because of this, they decided to tear down and rebuild. The planning was from 1506-1607. The new plan, by Maderno, retained the altar and tomb in the center of a Latin cross, with an elongated nave and a large facade. The church runs east to west, rather than west to east, due to the location of the tomb and the topography. The dome was completed in 1612 by Giacomo della Porta and Domenico Fontana
## Gianlorenzo Bernini
Son of a sculptor, received artistic education. He was the official architect of St. Peter's from 1629-1680, after the church was built. He constructed the Baldacchino (the structure over the tomb) and the colonnade and piazza. He described the Piazza as a maternal figure that had open arms to receive the faithful, heretics, and unbelievers.

## St. Peter's Basilica
![[Pasted image 20231031133648.png]]
Tripartite facade. Commissioned by Pope Urban VIII (Maffeo Barberini). The interior features much bronze, which was stripped from the pantheon by order of the Pope, which was not a popular decision. There many references to the Barberini coat of arms on the tomb and altar, such as the figures at the bottom of the columns, and the bees on the columns, thus inserting the Pope into the history and narrative of the church. 
# France
## Versailles
 In 1623, Louis XIII builds hunging lodge. In 1668, Louis XIV rebuilt the Louvre in Paris and Versailles. Chateau designed by Louis Le Vaus and Jules Hardouin. Garden by André Le Nôtre.

### Gardens
Le Notre created major east-west axis with intersecting diagonal avenues, gardens and fountains. The army diverted a river to provide water for the 1400 fountains of Versailles. During the French Revolution, this was not damaged, as it was viewed as a symbol of France.

## Paris

King Louis XIV collected art, which was opened to the public in the French Revolution.

# England
## Christopher Wren
Studdied mathematics, astronomy, and anatomy. He invented the *Panorganum Astronomicum*, a model to demonstrate the periodical positions of the Earth, Moon, and Sun. In 1666, he was appointed to oversee the rebuilding of London after the Great Fire of London. 
## Saint Paul's Cathedral, Christopher Wren, 1675-1709
This sought to look back to the Gothic forms while using the newer Baroque style. The plan, the "Warrant Design", was based on basilica, references to Gothic Architecture. Uses a triple dome design. The interior layer was masonry, the second was a brick cone, and the exterior was wooden. The Facade was influenced by the Louvre, with flanking towers inspired by Church of Sant Agnese. 



# Austria
## Karlskirche, Vienna, Johann Bernhard Fischer von Erlach, 1716-1725 (PLAN WILL BE ON EXAM)
Church was commissioned by the emperor Charles VI in fulfillment of a vow that he made (Prayer to Charles and Mary) in 1713 during an outbreak of the plague. The entrance of the facade is a reference to the Pantheon. The dome was inspired by St. Peter's. The two columns feature sculptures all the way up and around with scenes from the life of St. Charles Borromeo. The use of sculpture on the towers was inspired by the Column of Trajan in Rome, while the use of two towers flanking the entrance was a reference to Hagia Sophia.
