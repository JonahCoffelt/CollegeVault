## Four components of traditional building:
1. Foundations **platform** of stone or brick
2. Timber **frame** with columns and brackets
3. Wooden **purlins** (roof beams)
4. Decorative **roof** (roof tiles)
## Organization of Space
- Based on a modular design (**Jian = module**). The jian is a rectangular space defined by four walls. This organization could be expanded or repeated. Often featured a central courtyard.  
- Based on an axis with symmetry on each side. The axis would usually follow a spatial sequence, such as a hall-courtyard sequence.
