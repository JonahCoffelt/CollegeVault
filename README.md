# Jonah Coffelt's Vault
Welcome to my primary Obsidian Vault! Here, I store my college notes as well as some notes for my projects.

# Organization
Generally, I have all of my files sorted by topic/class. Within a topic, the literature folder will contain my refined notes, whereas other notes were temporary.

# Plugins
I primarily use the Desmos, Advanced Tables, and Kanban plugins.
