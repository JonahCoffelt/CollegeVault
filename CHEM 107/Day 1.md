# Matter
Matter is anything that has mass and takes up space. It can be broken  into two basic groups:
## Pure substance
Cannot be easily broken apart without a chemical reaction
### Compound
Atoms that are chemically bonded together

## Mixture
- Heterogeneous mixtures are more "chunky" (like salad) and not uniformly distributed
- Homogeneous mixtures are uniform. This is called a solution. 

## Phases/States of Matter
### Solid
Atoms are locked together
Has a definite volume and shape
### Liquid
Atoms get more free and can flow
Has a definite volume and indefinite shape
### Gas
Atoms are mostly free
Has indefinite volume and shape

## Properties
## Physical Properties
Can be measured through observations, not changing the composition or identity of the substance. A Phase change is a physical change. 
## Chemical Properties
Describes the way things can change. This can be flammability or corrosivity. This involves a chemical reaction. 

# Atomic Structure
In the center, there is the nucleus which contain neutrons and protons. Outside of that is the electron cloud which contains electrons. Thus most of the mass in in the center of the atom

| E        | Mass                  | Charge |
| -------- | --------------------- | ------ |
| Proton   | $1.67\cdot10^{-27}kg$ | +1     |
| Neutron  | $1.67\cdot10^{-27}kg$ | 0      |
| Electron | $9.11\cdot10^{-31}kg$ | -1     |

# Ions
## Cations
Are positive and usually formed in metals
## Anions
Are negative and usually formed in non-metals

| Symbol         | Protons | Neutrons | Electrons | Charge |
| -------------- | ------- | -------- | --------- | ------ |
| $^{238}U$      | 92      | 146      | 92        | 0      |
| $^{40}Ca^{2+}$ | 20      | 20       | 18        | 2+     |
| $^{79}Br^{-}$ | 35      | 44       | 36        | 1-     |
| $^{31}P^{3-}$  | 15      | 16       | 18          | 3-     |

# Isotopes
Atoms with a different number of neutron than other atoms with the same atomic number.
