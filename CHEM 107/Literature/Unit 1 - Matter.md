# Properties of Matter
## The Macroscopic Perspective
![[Matter]]
Everyday we observe matter at the macroscopic scale. However, not everything we see is matter, in fact, light is not matter, because it has no mass. 

The most common way in which we observe matter is by changing it. There are two types of changes, physical and chemical. Chemical changes alter the identity of a substance, while physical changes do not. A state change is a physical change, as it can easily be undone. 
### Physical Properties
These are variables that can be observed without changing the identity of an object. For example, mass can be measured by using a scale. Other physical properties include density, color, viscosity, and temperature,. In addition to these, there also state properties, such as heat capacity, boiling point, melting point, and volatility.
### Chemical Properties
There properties are associated with a chemical change, so the substance must undergo a change for these to be observed. Combustion, or burning in oxygen, is a chemical property, because it requires the substance to be burned to be observed. Corrosion, which is degradation of metal in the presence of air and moisture, is also a chemical property, as the metal must be corroded in order for this property to be observed. 

There are three common states of matter at this level, solid, liquid, and gas
### Solids
These are hard and do not easily change shape. Solid retains shape rather than taking that of its container. Solids have a constant shape and volume.
### Liquids
These adapt to the shape of their container, however they do not take up the full volume. Thus liquids have a nonconstant shape, but a constant volume.
### Gases
Gas, unlike liquid, will expand to fill the entire volume of its container. Gas has varying shape and volume. 
## The Microscopic Perspective
All matter is composed of atoms and molecules. Chemist usually think of everything as being "a chemical". There are a limited number of building blocks to matter, called elements.
![[Elements]]
In addition to these, we have atoms
![[Atoms]]
On top of this, there are molecules
![[Molecules]]
Often times, these will be represented with simplified drawings, as their scale is too small.

So how does this understanding contribute to the states of matter that we see at the macroscopics scale? For solids, the molecules are tightly packed together, which helps them to retain their shape. Liquid molecules are also quite close, though they are free to flow around. Gas molecules are able to freely move independently, allowing gas to fill a space.

We can see here how, as described earlier, a state change is not a chemical change. In all states, we still have the same molecule, so there has been no identity change. 

# Atomic Structure
## Fundamental Concepts
The atom has a small core, know as the nucleus, comprised of protons and neutrons., surrounded by a cloud of electrons. The electron cloud takes up much much more space than the nucleus.

| Type     | Charge                 | Integer Charge | Mass |
| -------- | ---------------------- | -------------- | ---- |
| Proton   | $+1.602\cdot10^{-19}C$ | +1             | 1    |
| Neutron  | 0                      | 0              | 1    |
| Electron | $-1.602\cdot10^{-19}C$ | -1              | 1     |

For an atom to remain neutral, there must be the same number of protons and electrons, as they have the same but opposite charges.
## Atomic Number and Mass Number
The atomic number refers to the number of protons in the atom, which can be found on the periodic table. This is used to identify the element. For the atom to be neutrally charged, the number of electrons is the same as the number of protons. Generally, atoms have the same or more neutrons as protons. For example, a carbon atom has 6 protons (as identified by its atomic number), 6 electrons, and 6 neutrons. 

The Mass number is simply the amount of protons plus the amount of neutrons. In the previous example, the carbon atom has 6 protons + 6 neutrons, thus it has a mass number of 12 amu
$$1\ amu = 1.6605\cdot10^{-24}g$$
We can label an atom based on the number of protons it has, so this one would be called carbon-12, which we could also write as $^{12}C$ .
### Isotopes
Atoms that have the same number of protons (same element) but a different number of neutrons are isotopes. For example, we could have carbon-12 and carbon-13, which have 6 and 7 neutrons respectively. 
## Atomic Symbols
Though I slightly mentioned it, here is how we notate atoms: $$^A_ZX$$
Where $X$ is an element, $A$  is the mass number, and $Z$ is the atomic number. For example, an atom of iron with 26 protons, 30 neutrons would be notated as such: $$^{56}_{26}Fe$$
## Atomic Weight
In addition to atomic number, there is another value often given by the periodic table, the atomic weight. This number is the average mass of all the naturally occurring isotopes of that element. 
![[Pasted image 20230825152215.png]]
Here, we can see that although carbon-12 of atomic weight 12, the most common form of carbon, making up about 99% of all naturally occurring carbon atoms, the atomic weight is slightly higher. This is because there are some natural occurrences of carbon-13, which raises the average to the number shown in the box. 

To find this number, we take what is known as a weighted average like so:

| Carbon-12                 | $12.0\cdot 0.9893=11.87$     |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Carbon-13                 | $13.003355\cdot 0.0107=1.39$ |
| Weighted average mass $=$ | $11.87+0.139=\boxed{12.011}$         |



# Ions
An Ion is a particle with a charge that is not neutral. This happens when the number of electrons is different that the number of protons. These are **not** atoms, and behave differently from atoms. 

There are two types of Ions:
![[Monatomic Ions]]
![[Polyatomic Ions]]

Which can both we positively or negatively charged. We have special names for positive and negative ions:
![[Anion]]
![[Cation]]

We notate ions almost the same as atoms, except we add a superscript to the right of the element (determined by the number of protons of the ion) denoting the charge. We name our ions based off of their element and charge. For cations, the name is just the element and "ion". Anions have the element name with the ending 
"-ide". Here are some examples:

# Compounds and Chemical Bonds
A chemical compound it a pure substance made up of atoms of two or more elements joined together by chemical bonds. Many compounds form discrete particles called molecules
![[Molecules]]

## Chemical Formulas
A chemical formula describes a compound with its constituent elements. A molecular formula lists all of the atoms of an element, using a subscript to show how many of each element there are:
$$\boxed{H_2O_2}$$
An empirical formula is a ratio, so it expresses the same compound, but in simplest integer form:
$$H_2O_z\rightarrow \boxed{HO}$$
We can use parentheses and a subscript to be more specific about the number of element atoms:
$$H_2O_z\rightarrow \boxed{(HO)_2}$$
## Chemical Bonding
All chemical bons involve the sharing of electrons, which results in lower energy for the compound relative to the individual atoms. Because of this, a chemical bond will only form is the overall energy of the compound it lowered. There are 3 types of chemical bonds:
### Ionic Bonding
Formed between a metal and non-metal. To form a compound out of Ions, one atom loses an election to become an anion, while another gains an electron to become a cation. Because these two are oppositely charged, they are attracted and bonded to each other. If we have an array of these, with alternating negative and positive ions, it is called a lattice.
![[Pasted image 20230828175711.png]]
### Metallic Bonding
Formed between two metals. Metals will bond together by contributing an election to a "sea" of electrons. This makes them positive, thus they are attracted tot he negative pool of electrons. This gives metal much of its properties, as it can conduct due to the free movement of electrons, and it is malleable due to the lack of strict bonds. 
![[Pasted image 20230828183556.png]]
### Covalent Bonding
Formed between two non-metals. To form this bond, atoms will share one or more electrons to be more stable. For example, oxygen has 6 valence electrons, so it will share two electrons with another oxygen so they both have 8.
![[Pasted image 20230828192800.png]]
Sometimes, the two atoms do not share the electron equally, so it will leave one slightly positive and one slightly negative. This happens with a covalent bond between an oxygen and two hydrogens. The shared electrons will tend to be more towards the oxygen, resulting in the oxygen being slightly negative, and the hydrogens being slightly positive.
