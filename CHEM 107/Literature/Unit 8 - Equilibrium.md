# 12.2 - Chemical Equilibrium
Reactions are at equilibrium when the concentrations of the reacting chemicals are stable. However, the forward and backward reactions will still be taking place, but they will be at the same rate, so they balance. This is called a dynamic equilibrium. 
## Mathematical Relationship
For any reaction with reactants R and products P which react both forward and backward, assume: $$R\rightleftharpoons P$$
We can write a rate law for both the forward and the reverse reactions: $$Rate_{forward}=k_{forward}[R]$$
$$Rate_{reverse}=k_{reverse}[P]$$
At equilibrium, these two rates must be equal to each other, thus: $$k_{forward}[R]_{eq}=k_{reverse}[P]_{eq}$$
the subscript "eq" is meant to denote the equilibrium concentration of a substance. We can manipulate the equation to give the following: $$\frac{k_{forward}}{k_{reverse}}=\frac{[P]_{eq}}{[R]_{eq}}$$

# 12.3 - Equilibrium Constants
## The Equilibrium (Mass Action) Expression
For a general chemical reaction: $$aA+bB\rightleftharpoons cC+dD$$
We can define a ratio of concentrations regardless of equilibrium: $$Q=\frac{[C]^c[D]^d}{[A]^a[B]^b}$$
This is the reaction quotient. At equilibrium, Q is the equilibrium constant, $K_{eq}$.
## Gas Phase Equilibria
It is sometimes easier to use partial pressures, rather than molarity, for gases. Because of this, we can use a similar equation, but using partial pressures of each substance. $$K_p=\frac{(P_C)^c(P_D)^d}{(P_A)^a(P_B)^b}$$
We can relate the two methods of finding constants with the following equation: $$K_p=K_c\times(RT)^{(\Delta n_{gas})}$$
## Homogeneous and Heterogeneous Equilibria
When it comes to heterogeneous equilibria, there needs to be a slight adjustment. Because we don't really have concentrations for solids or gasses, we simple replace them with a 1 in our equation (Don't factor it in, essentially)
## Numerical Importance of the Equilibrium Expression
Equilibrium vary from magnitudes $10^{-99}$ to $10^{99}$ and greater. So what does the size of this number mean? Lets look at the expression for K: $$K=\frac{[Products]}{[Reactants]}$$
For a large value of K, there must be a high concentration of productions, and for small values of K, there must be a high concentration of reactants. Thus if $K>1$, then the reaction is product favored, and if $K<1$, then the reaction is reactant favored. 

## Mathematical Manipulation of Equilibrium Constants
### Reversing Chemical Equation
If the constant for the forward reaction is K, then the constant for the reverse reaction is $\frac1K$. 
### Adjusting the Stoichiometry of the Chemical Reaction
If we adjust the Stoichiometry of a chemical reaction, then we must update all of the corresponding order exponents.

# 12.6/12.7 - Solubility Equilibrium
Though wee have said that some ionic compounds are entirely insoluble, most will dissolve a small amount at least, making them sparingly soluble. Because the concentration of a solid in not use, we will not be taking into account the concentration of the solid salt, so only the dissolved ions will appear. The constant found from these is known as the solubility product constant ($K_{sp}$) For example: $$Ca(OH)_2(s)\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+}(aq)+2OH^-(aq)$$
$$K_{sp}=[Ca^{2+}][OH^-]^2=7.9\times10^{-6}$$
Here, we can see that the $K_{sp}$ value is very low, so very little of the compound is dissolved. 
# 12.8 - Free Energy and Equilibrium
Equilibrium is a state of minimum free energy. Thus systems move toward equilibrium because it lowers their free energy. $\Delta G=0$ at equilibrium.
