# 11.2 - Rates of Chemical Reactions
In general, if any chemical is produced faster than it is consumed, it will accumulate.
## Rate and Rates of Reaction
We know that we can calculate the average speed using a change in distance over a change in time: $$Average\ Speed=\frac{\Delta d}{\Delta t}$$
This concept can be translated into chemistry. To do this, we can think about the concentration as the "distance" a chemical equation has traveled: $$Rate=\frac{\Delta [Substance]}{\Delta t}$$
Due to the units of this ratio, the unit for the rate is: $$\frac{mol\ L^{-1}}{s}=mol\ L^{-1}s^{-1}$$
## Stoichiometry and Rate
Given the formula $N_2+2O_2\rightarrow2NO_2$ which chemical do we use to find the rate, as the rate of formation for $NO_2$ would be twice the rate of disappearance of $N_2$. We can use both, if we account for the coefficient. To do this, we add it to the denominator of our equation from above. $$Rate=\frac{\Delta [Substance]}{v_{react}\Delta t}$$
# 11.3 - Rates Laws
The rate of a rection depends on a number of factors, and it often is variable during a reaction. Concentration is one factor that can be helpful when finding a rate.
## The Rate Law
The rate of reaction is dependent on concentration. For a reaction between two substances X and Y:
$$Rate=k[X]^m[Y]^n$$
Where $k$ is the rate constant and $m$ and $n$ are the order of reaction. If $m=1$, then the reaction is first order with respect to X; If $m=2$, then the reaction is second order with respect to X. In the following reaction: $$Rate=k[A][B]$$
the overall order of reaction is second order, because A and B are first order. 
The magnitude of the rate constant generally tells us how fast the reaction will be. A large rate constant generally means a fast reaction, and a small rate constant means a slow reaction. The rate constant is dependent on temperature. 
## Determination of the Rate Law
As stated, the concentration has an affect on the rate, but this affect varies based on the order of that reactant. Consider the simple rate: $$Rate=k[A]^n$$
We can predict how doubling the concentration of A for different orders of reaction (n):

1. $n=0$, doubling $[A]$ will have no affect ($[A]^0=1$)
2. $n=1$, doubling $[A]$ will double the rate
3. $n=2$, doubling $[A]$ will multiply the rate by 4

Thus, if we wanted to know the order of an unknown reaction like this, we could simply see how the rate changes to according to a change in concentration.

This may not work if we have two substances:$$Rate=[A]^n[B]^m$$
Because we have 3 variables, k, n, and m. Thus to find the order of A, the concentration of B should be held constant while A is changed. The same thing can be done with B. This can be represented in a table:

| Experiment | Initial $[NO_2]$     | Initial $[O_3]$      | Initial Rate of Reactions |
| ---------- | -------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------- |
| 1          | $2.3\times  10^{-5}$ | $3.0\times  10^{-5}$ | $1.0\times  10^{-5}$      |
| 2          | $4.6\times  10^{-5}$ | $3.0\times  10^{-5}$ | $2.1\times  10^{-5}$      |
| 3          | $4.6\times  10^{-5}$ | $6.0\times  10^{-5}$ | $4.2\times  10^{-5}$      |

Given the table, we can see that $[NO_2]$ is first order and $[O_3]$ is first order

# 11.4 - Integrated Rate Laws
Similar to how we can find the final position of a projectile given its position, intimal velocity, and acceleration, we can use the integrated rate law to fine the concentrations or rate at some later time. 
## Zero-Order
$$[A]_t=[A]_0-kt$$
This is a linear equation, where $-k$ is the slope. Thus given a graph of concentration over time, if it is linear, it is a zero-order reaction, and $k=-m$.
## First-Order
$$[A]_t=[A]_0e^{-kt}$$
or
$$ln[A]_t=-kt+ln[A]_0$$
The graph for concentration over time would not be linear, but an exponential decay curve. However, being non-linear does not guarantee that the rate is first order, so we can look and the graph for natural log of concentration over time (The equation is the second one above), which would be linear and $k=-m$.
## Second Order
$$\frac1{[A]_t}-\frac1{[A]_0}=kt$$
The linear plot for the second order will be $\frac1{[A]_t}$ over time, and $m=k$
# 11.5 - Temperature and Kinetics
According to the kinetic-molecular theory, molecules must collide to react. However, a collision does not guarantee a reaction, so there must be something that makes a reaction happen. Oftentimes, a faster collision will be able to result in a reaction, thus reactions tend to be more likely at higher temperatures. 

## Arrhenius Behavior
The temperature dependence of a rate constant can be express as such: $$k=Ae^{-E_a/RT}$$
Where $E_a$ is the activations energy, $T$ is is the temperature in kelvin, and $A$ is the proportionality constant. Small changes in any of these can have a large impact on the rate. 
# 11.7 - Catalysis
Other substances can speed up a reaction. A Catalysis is able to do this, but it is not a reactant nor product of the reaction. 
## Homogeneous and Heterogeneous Catalysts
There are two broad categories for catalysts: Homogeneous Catalysts, those which are the same phase as the reacting substances, and heterogeneous, those which in a different phase. 

## Molecular Perspective of Catalysis
Catalysts increase the rate of reaction by providing an alternate multi-step path which lowers the total activation energy.
