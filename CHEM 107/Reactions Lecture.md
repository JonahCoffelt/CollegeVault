# Combustion
# Precipitation Reaction
A reaction between two liquids or aqueous solutions which creates a precipitate
![[Precipitate]]
## Example:
### Molecular Equation
$$2Kl_{(aq)}+Pb(NO_3)_{2(aq)}\rightarrow PbI_{2(s)}+2KNO_{3(aq)}$$
This molecular equation can be written in a net ionic equation:
# Ionic Equation
The ions we remove are called spectator ions, because they do not react. If the spectator ions were not there, the reaction would still occur. 
$$Pb^{2+}+2I^-\rightarrow PbI$$
## Practice Problems
### Molecular Equation
$$AgNO_{3(aq)}+KCl_{(aq)}\rightarrow AgCl_{(s)}+KNO_{3(aq)}$$
### Ionic Equation
$$Ag_{(aq)}^++Cl_{(aq)}^-\rightarrow AgCl_{(s)}$$
## Practice Problem 2
$$Pb(NO_3)_{s(aq)}+(NH_4)_2S_{(aq)}\rightarrow PbS_{(s)}+2NO_3NH_{4(aq)}$$
$$Pb^{2+}_{(aq)}+S^{2-}_{(aq)}\rightarrow PbS_{(s)}$$
## Practice Problem 3
$$2NaCl_{(aq)}+K_2SO_{4(aq)}\rightarrow Na_2SO_{4(aq)}+2KCl_{(aq)}$$
Here, there was no precipitate formed, so there was no reaction.
